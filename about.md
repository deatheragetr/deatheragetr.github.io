<h5><blink>Details</blink></h5>
<p>Thomas is an OK software engineer and mediocre designer. </p>
<p>He lives in a 1 bedroom apartment in NYC.</p>
<p>He was raised in Virginia, born in Pennsylvania and conceived in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>He <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is single</span> has a girlfriend.</p>
<p>His current role is CTO & Co-founder of <a href="https://funder.dog/">funder.dog</a>, where he builds conversational bots to boost fundraising efforts for non-profits. Software is eating the world. Web is eating software. Bots are eating the web. Thomas is likely eating his own words.</p>
<p>His design influences include <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> bio.</p>
<p>His web technology experiences include, but are not limited to: Ruby (both Rails _and_ Sinatra), Node.js, Perl, Python, React, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Meteor, poorly designed Raspberry Pi/Arduino hardware hacks, and JSONAPI -- <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">the antibikeshdding tool</a></p>
<p>Interesting facts: Thomas once cost his empolyer over $15k in losses after he forgot to specify UTF-8 on a database migration script. Now he never forgets his character encodings. </p>
<p>Interesting facts: Seven years of Catholic school means Thomas can write illegibly in both print <i>and</i> cursive.</p>
Interesting facts: Yes the HTML ```<blink>``` tag has long been deprecated. Yes this site is using a CSS polyfill for ```<blink>```. Improvise. Overcome. Adapt.
<p>Interesting facts: Thomas once received a callback to audition for the bachelorette. He was rejected. Oh Rachel, alas you'll always be the one who got away 💔.</p>
<p>If one learns by failing, Thomas is one highly educated individual.</p>
